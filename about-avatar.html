            This avatar design, made by me, is actually filled with tiny details and nods to me and my
            interests. Let me
            explain some of them!<br><br>First and foremost, the background features a snowflake, representing my
            favorite
            season, the winter. The days of the holidays are always a pleasure to get to experience
            .<br><br>Furthermore,
            the avatar design actually has my initials (C.B.A) in it:<br><br>
            <img src="./assets/initials.gif" style="display:block;width:70%;margin:auto;"><br><br>Also, it is made of 3 elements: &lt;, /, and &gt;.<br>Looks familiar? That's right, it's the HTML
            closing tag (&lt;/&gt;)!
