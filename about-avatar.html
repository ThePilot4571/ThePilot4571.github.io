    <p>This avatar design, made by me, is actually filled with tiny details and nods to me and my interests. Let me explain some of them!<br><br>First and foremost, the background features a snowflake, representing my favorite season, the winter. The days of the holidays are always a pleasure to get to experience .<br><br>Furthermore, the avatar design actually has my initials (C.B.A) in it. <img width=300px height=300px src="./assets/initials.gif" style="margin-top: 3rem;"> <br><br> Fancy!</p>
