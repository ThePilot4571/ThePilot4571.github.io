        This avatar design, made by me, is actually filled with tiny details and nods to me and my
        interests. Let me
        explain some of them!<br><br>First and foremost, the background features a snowflake, representing my favorite
        season, the winter. The days of the holidays are always a pleasure to get to experience .<br><br>Furthermore,
        the avatar design actually has my initials (C.B.A) in it: 
        <img width=300px height=300px src="./assets/initials.gif" style="margin-top: 3rem;"> <br><br>
        Furthermore, it is made of 3 elements: &lt;, /, and &gt;. <br>Looks familiar? That's right, it's the HTML
        closing tag (&lt;/&gt;)!
